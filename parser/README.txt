               TurteleSense - Sensor Report Parser

  What is it?
  -----------

  The TurtleSense Report Parser is a PHP script that reads text 
  files (reports) FTP'd to the server by communication devices 
  located in the field to transmit sensor data generated by 
  TurtleSense sensor devices planted in turtle nests.

  How is it used?
  ---------------

  The script is triggered by a cron job every minute, where it
  looks for newly loaded files in the FTP directory.

  Installation
  ------------

  Place the "parser" directory in the web root and set the path 
  to the script, in a cron script.
  
  Configure these files:
  
    Production:
      parser/application/config/live/config.php
      parser/application/config/live/database.php
  
    Staging:
      parser/application/config/staging/config.php
      parser/application/config/staging/database.php
  
    Local:
      parser/application/config/local/config.php
      parser/application/config/local/database.php
  
  Create parser/env.txt with only the name of the configuration 
  files' directory name. ie., staging
  
  Go to the parser's home page at ts, and click "Parse Now".
  This will run the parser for the first time and let you know
  if you have any configuration problems.
